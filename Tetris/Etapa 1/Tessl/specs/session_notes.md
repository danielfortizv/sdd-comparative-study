# Tessl Session Notes: Browser-Based Tetris Study - Stage 1, Option A

This document logs the usage of Tessl's context plugins and tool integrations in this run.

## 1. Tessl Integration and Status

- **Tessl Status Check:** Run via MCP `mcp_tessl_status` showing:
  - Plugin `maria/fastapi` (v0.1.0) is in-sync.
  - Plugin `softaworks/agent-toolkit` is in-sync (commit `3027f20f3181758385a1bb8c022d4041dfb4de84`).
  - Readiness state is `"partial"` (unauthenticated but local project is in-sync).
- **Available Skills Leveraged:**
  - `maria/fastapi#scaffold-project`: Guidelines for scaffolding the FastAPI project structure.
  - `maria/fastapi#run-check-server`: Guidelines for starting the server and running pytest validation.
  - `softaworks/agent-toolkit#react-dev`: Coding patterns for React 19 / React TypeScript development.

## 2. Specification Workflow

The project's requirements specifications and implementation plan were designed under the `specs/` folder prior to any coding work to establish clean, decoupled architectures.
- `specs/requirements.md` defines 30 atomic, testable requirements covering board layout, pieces, legal moves, collisions, locking, line clearing, game over, and API endpoints.

This ensures that the final codebase complies strictly with the Stage 1 Option A expectations.
