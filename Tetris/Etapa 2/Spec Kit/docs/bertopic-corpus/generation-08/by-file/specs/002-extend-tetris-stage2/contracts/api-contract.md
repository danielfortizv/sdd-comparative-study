# REST API Contract Specification: Extend Tetris to Stage 2

This document defines the REST API contract details exposed by the Python FastAPI backend to the React/TypeScript frontend client for the Stage 2 Tetris features.

---

## Endpoint Overview

All endpoints consume and return `application/json`. Game session states are managed server-side and mapped to a unique UUID.

| Method | Endpoint | Request Body | Response Body | Description |
|--------|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/games` | *None* | `GameSession` | Creates or restarts a game session, initializing all Stage 2 variables to default. |
| `GET` | `/api/games/{id}` | *None* | `GameSession` | Retrieves the current authoritative game state of a session. |
| `POST` | `/api/games/{id}/tick` | *None* | `GameSession` | Advances gravity down by 1 row, checking for locking, line clearing, scoring, leveling, and piece respawn. |
| `POST` | `/api/games/{id}/move` | `MoveRequest` | `GameSession` | Performs a manual left, right, or down shift. |
| `POST` | `/api/games/{id}/hold` | *None* | `GameSession` | Performs a piece swap with the Hold slot (or stores the active piece). |
