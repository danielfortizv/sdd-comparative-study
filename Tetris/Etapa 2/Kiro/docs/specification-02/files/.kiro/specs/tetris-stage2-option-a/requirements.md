# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the functional scope for Stage 2, Option A, of a browser-based Tetris study. It is a brownfield extension of the existing Stage 1, Option A implementation that lives in this same tool's workspace (`backend/` FastAPI service and `frontend/` React + TypeScript client, with the Stage 1 native specification under `.kiro/specs/tetris-stage1-option-a/`). The Stage 1 behavior and contracts are the baseline and must be preserved; Stage 2 only adds the features described below.

Stage 2 adds a **score**, a **cumulative cleared-line count**, a **level**, **progressive gravity**, a **one-piece Hold**, and a **one-piece next-piece preview**. The backend remains the single authoritative owner of game state and rules; the frontend renders backend state and forwards controls. There is no database and no authentication; all state remains in memory only.

The following remain explicitly out of scope for this stage and must not be introduced: rotation, wall kicks, T-Spins, ghost piece, time attack, achievements, persistence, database, authentication, multiplayer, and high-score storage.

### Relationship to Stage 1 (preserved baseline)

The following Stage 1 facts are inputs and must not be changed by Stage 2. They are reproduced here so Stage 2 acceptance criteria can reference them precisely.

- **Board:** 20 rows by 10 columns. Row `0` is the top, row `19` is the bottom; column `0` is leftmost, column `9` is rightmost.
- **Pieces:** the seven standard tetrominoes `I`, `O`, `T`, `S`, `Z`, `J`, `L` in their initial (unrotated) orientation only. The canonical relative offsets are:
  - `I`: `[0,0] [0,1] [0,2] [0,3]`
  - `O`: `[0,0] [0,1] [1,0] [1,1]`
  - `T`: `[0,1] [1,0] [1,1] [1,2]`
  - `S`: `[0,1] [0,2] [1,0] [1,1]`
  - `Z`: `[0,0] [0,1] [1,1] [1,2]`
  - `J`: `[0,0] [1,0] [1,1] [1,2]`
  - `L`: `[0,2] [1,0] [1,1] [1,2]`
- **Shape height:** every canonical shape above spans at most two rows. This remains true in Stage 2 and bounds what is reachable in ordinary play (see Requirement 5).
- **Spawn origin:** `(row 0, column 3)`. A piece whose spawn cells overlap a settled block or leave the board ends the game.
- **Piece generator:** a seeded deterministic shuffled 7-bag. The same seed produces the same type sequence. This behavior is retained unchanged; the only change is that Stage 2 exposes one previewed next piece and must draw exactly one new preview on the events defined below.
- **Board serialization:** JSON board is a 20x10 array of integer codes, `0` = empty and `1..7` = settled block type codes (`I=1, O=2, T=3, S=4, Z=5, J=6, L=7`). Integer codes, not letters, are used for board cells.
- **Legacy response key:** the active piece is exposed under the key `active_piece` (with `type`, `origin`, `cells`). This key name is retained.
- **Endpoints:** `POST /api/games`, `GET /api/games/{id}`, `POST /api/games/{id}/tick`, `POST /api/games/{id}/move` keep their existing request/response compatibility. `POST /api/games` returns HTTP 200 (not 201).
- **Status values:** `playing` and `game_over`.
- **Lock / clear / spawn ordering:** on a lock, the active piece settles into the board, completed lines are cleared, and only then is the next piece spawned. This tool's own ordering is the baseline; no terminal ordering from any other implementation is an input.
- **Regression tests:** the 39 existing backend test functions (27 in `backend/tests/test_rules.py`, 12 in `backend/tests/test_api.py`) are regression assertions that must continue to pass unchanged.

### New data and coordinate conventions

- **Score:** a non-negative integer, initially `0`.
- **Total lines:** a non-negative integer counting all rows cleared since the game started, initially `0`.
- **Level:** a positive integer, initially `1`, derived as `1 + floor(total_lines / 10)`.
- **Gravity interval (ms):** a positive integer, initially `500`, derived as `max(100, 500 - 50 * (level - 1))`.
- **Next piece (`next_piece`):** the single piece type that will spawn next; always present (non-null) while the game is readable.
- **Hold piece (`hold_piece`):** the single piece type currently held, or `null` when the hold slot is empty.
- **Can hold (`can_hold`):** a boolean; `true` when a Hold is allowed for the current active piece, `false` once Hold has been used for the current active piece and until the next piece locks.

### Glossary

- **Consume the preview:** take the current `next_piece` as the piece to bring into play, then draw exactly one new preview from the seeded 7-bag so `next_piece` is refilled.
- **Spawn origin / initial orientation:** `(0, 3)` with the canonical unrotated offsets for the piece type.
- **Pre-lock level:** the value of `level` immediately before the lock currently being resolved, i.e. the level used to multiply the line-clear score for that lock.
- **Study controls:** the exact numeric scoring, leveling, and gravity formulas below are fixed experimental controls. They do not authorize rotation or any other out-of-scope feature.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: New game initial counters

**User Story:** As a player, I want a new game to start from a known baseline, so that scoring and pacing are predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game is created via `POST /api/games` THEN the system SHALL set `score` to `0`.
2. WHEN a game is created THEN the system SHALL set `total_lines` to `0`.
3. WHEN a game is created THEN the system SHALL set `level` to `1`.
4. WHEN a game is created THEN the system SHALL set `gravity_interval_ms` to `500`.
5. WHEN a game is created THEN the system SHALL set `hold_piece` to `null`.
6. WHEN a game is created THEN the system SHALL set `can_hold` to `true`.
7. WHEN a game is created THEN the system SHALL set `next_piece` to a non-null piece type.

### Requirement 2: Score awarded per lock by cleared-row count and pre-lock level

**User Story:** As a player, I want points for clearing lines, so that I am rewarded for play.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lock clears exactly 1 row THEN the system SHALL add `100 * pre_lock_level` to `score`.
2. WHEN a lock clears exactly 2 rows THEN the system SHALL add `300 * pre_lock_level` to `score`.
3. WHEN a lock clears exactly 3 rows THEN the system SHALL add `500 * pre_lock_level` to `score`.
4. WHEN a lock clears exactly 4 rows THEN the system SHALL add `800 * pre_lock_level` to `score`.
5. WHEN a lock clears 0 rows THEN the system SHALL add `0` to `score`.
6. WHEN computing the line-clear award for a lock THEN the system SHALL multiply by the level value in effect immediately before that lock (the pre-lock level), not the level after any resulting level increase.

### Requirement 3: Cumulative line count and level derivation

**User Story:** As a player, I want levels to rise as I clear lines, so that the game gets harder.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lock clears `n` rows (`n` in `0..4`) THEN the system SHALL increase `total_lines` by `n` after computing that lock's score.
2. WHEN `total_lines` changes THEN the system SHALL set `level` to `1 + floor(total_lines / 10)`.
3. WHEN `total_lines` is `0` through `9` THEN `level` SHALL equal `1`.
4. WHEN `total_lines` is `10` through `19` THEN `level` SHALL equal `2`.
5. WHEN a lock clears no rows THEN `total_lines` and `level` SHALL remain unchanged.

### Requirement 4: Progressive gravity interval derivation

**User Story:** As a player, I want pieces to fall faster at higher levels, so that difficulty scales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `level` changes THEN the system SHALL set `gravity_interval_ms` to `max(100, 500 - 50 * (level - 1))`.
2. WHEN `level` is `1` THEN `gravity_interval_ms` SHALL equal `500`.
3. WHEN `level` is `9` THEN `gravity_interval_ms` SHALL equal `100`.
4. WHEN `level` is `10` or greater THEN `gravity_interval_ms` SHALL equal `100` (the floor), never less than `100`.
5. WHEN crossing from a pre-lock `level` of `9` to a post-lock `level` of `10` on the same lock THEN the system SHALL compute that lock's score with the pre-lock level `9` AND SHALL set `gravity_interval_ms` to `100` after the level update.

### Requirement 5: Four-, three-, and two-row clears validated as isolated domain rules

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the multi-row scoring rules verified even though ordinary unrotated play cannot reach them, so that the scoring table is trustworthy without introducing rotation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scoring rule for 3 simultaneously cleared rows is verified THEN it SHALL be exercised through the real production clear-and-score path using an explicitly labeled isolated domain fixture (for example a crafted board with prefilled complete rows), not by presenting a rotated piece as valid UI play.
2. WHEN the scoring rule for 4 simultaneously cleared rows is verified THEN it SHALL be exercised through the real production clear-and-score path using an explicitly labeled isolated domain fixture, not by rotation.
3. WHEN verifying 3- and 4-row clears THEN the system SHALL NOT mutate the canonical unrotated shapes and SHALL NOT present artificially rotated pieces as valid gameplay in the UI.
4. WHEN verifying 0-, 1-, and 2-row clears THEN these cases MAY be reached either through ordinary play or through the same isolated domain fixtures, and SHALL use the real production clear-and-score path.
5. WHEN documenting verification THEN isolated-domain evidence SHALL be distinguished from user-visible / browser evidence.

### Requirement 6: State response exposes Stage 2 fields without consuming the queue

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want every state response to carry the Stage 2 fields, so that I can render them, and I want reads to be side-effect free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system returns game state THEN it SHALL include `score`, `total_lines`, `level`, `gravity_interval_ms`, `next_piece`, `hold_piece`, and `can_hold` in addition to the existing `id`, `status`, `board`, and `active_piece`.
2. WHEN the system returns game state THEN `next_piece` SHALL be a piece-type string (`I`,`O`,`T`,`S`,`Z`,`J`,`L`).
3. WHEN the system returns game state THEN `hold_piece` SHALL be a piece-type string or `null`.
4. WHEN the system returns game state THEN `can_hold` SHALL be a boolean.
5. WHEN a client sends `GET /api/games/{id}` THEN the response SHALL NOT change `score`, `total_lines`, `level`, `gravity_interval_ms`, `next_piece`, `hold_piece`, `can_hold`, the board, the active piece, the queued next piece, or the seeded generator / 7-bag state.
6. WHEN any number of consecutive state reads are issued THEN `next_piece` SHALL be identical across them until an event defined in Requirement 7 consumes it.

### Requirement 7: Preview queue consumption counts

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to know exactly when the previewed piece is drawn, so that the generator advances deterministically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a piece spawns normally (new game, after a lock, or a restart's first spawn) THEN the system SHALL consume the previewed piece as the piece that enters play AND SHALL draw exactly one new preview (exactly one generator draw for the preview on that event).
2. WHEN the first Hold for an active piece occurs AND the hold slot was empty THEN the system SHALL move the current active piece into the hold slot, consume the previewed piece to become the new active piece, AND draw exactly one new preview (exactly one generator draw).
3. WHEN a Hold swaps with an already-occupied hold slot THEN the system SHALL exchange the active piece with the held piece AND SHALL NOT consume the preview or draw any new preview (zero generator draws).
4. WHEN a Hold is rejected (because `can_hold` is `false`) THEN the system SHALL NOT change the board, active piece, hold piece, preview, counters, or generator state (zero generator draws).
5. WHEN a state read, a rejected action, or any move after game over occurs THEN the system SHALL perform zero generator draws and SHALL NOT advance the 7-bag.

### Requirement 8: Hold mechanics

**User Story:** As a player, I want to hold a piece for later, so that I can plan placements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `POST /api/games/{id}/hold` is called while `status` is `playing` AND `can_hold` is `true` AND the hold slot is empty THEN the system SHALL place the current active piece type into `hold_piece`, bring the previewed piece into play as the new active piece at the spawn origin in its initial orientation, draw one new preview, and set `can_hold` to `false`.
2. WHEN `POST /api/games/{id}/hold` is called while `status` is `playing` AND `can_hold` is `true` AND the hold slot is occupied THEN the system SHALL swap the active piece type with `hold_piece`, place the swapped-in piece at the spawn origin in its initial orientation, NOT consume the preview, and set `can_hold` to `false`.
3. WHEN a held or swapped-in piece is placed at the spawn origin AND its cells overlap a settled block or leave the board THEN the system SHALL set `status` to `game_over` and clear the active piece, consistent with Stage 1 spawn-collision behavior.
4. WHEN `POST /api/games/{id}/hold` is called while `can_hold` is `false` THEN the system SHALL reject the Hold and leave all state unchanged.
5. WHEN an active piece locks THEN the system SHALL set `can_hold` to `true` for the next active piece, re-enabling Hold once per active piece.
6. WHEN `POST /api/games/{id}/hold` targets an unknown game id THEN the system SHALL respond with HTTP 404.
7. WHEN `POST /api/games/{id}/hold` is called while `status` is `game_over` THEN the system SHALL leave all state unchanged.
8. WHEN the Hold endpoint returns THEN its response body SHALL use the same game-state shape as the other endpoints (Requirement 6).

### Requirement 9: Soft drop grants no points

**User Story:** As a player, I want soft drop to speed placement without inflating the score, so that scoring reflects line clears only.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a soft drop (`move` with `direction: "down"`) moves the active piece down THEN the system SHALL NOT change `score`.
2. WHEN a soft drop causes a lock THEN `score` SHALL change only according to the line-clear award rules in Requirement 2.

### Requirement 10: Rejected and post-game-over actions do not mutate state

**User Story:** As a player, I want invalid inputs ignored, so that game state stays consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the status is `game_over` AND a tick, move, or hold is sent THEN the system SHALL leave the board, active piece, counters, hold state, preview, and generator unchanged.
2. WHEN a Hold is rejected THEN the system SHALL leave all Stage 2 fields and generator state unchanged.
3. WHEN repeated state reads are issued THEN the system SHALL leave all Stage 2 fields and generator state unchanged.

### Requirement 11: Restart resets all Stage 2 state

**User Story:** As a player, I want restart to fully reset, so that a new game is clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends `POST /api/games` (restart) THEN the system SHALL reset `score` to `0`, `total_lines` to `0`, `level` to `1`, and `gravity_interval_ms` to `500`.
2. WHEN a restart occurs THEN the system SHALL clear `hold_piece` to `null` and set `can_hold` to `true`.
3. WHEN a restart occurs THEN the system SHALL produce a fresh active piece and a fresh non-null `next_piece` preview.
4. WHEN a restart occurs THEN the new game SHALL have a new unique id distinct from the previous game.

### Requirement 12: Existing endpoint compatibility preserved

**User Story:** As an integrator, I want the Stage 1 endpoints to keep working, so that existing clients and the 39 regression tests pass.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `POST /api/games` is called THEN the system SHALL respond with HTTP 200 and a game-state body.
2. WHEN `GET /api/games/{id}` is called for an existing game THEN the system SHALL return its current state; for an unknown id it SHALL respond HTTP 404.
3. WHEN `POST /api/games/{id}/tick` is called THEN the system SHALL advance one gravity tick (move down or lock) exactly as in Stage 1, now also applying Stage 2 scoring/leveling on any resulting clear.
4. WHEN `POST /api/games/{id}/move` is called with `left`, `right`, or `down` THEN the system SHALL behave as in Stage 1; a missing or invalid `direction` SHALL yield HTTP 422 and an unknown id SHALL yield HTTP 404.
5. WHEN the board is serialized THEN cells SHALL remain integer codes (`0` empty, `1..7` types) and the active piece SHALL remain under the `active_piece` key with `type`, `origin`, `cells`.
6. WHEN Stage 2 is implemented THEN all 39 existing backend regression test functions SHALL continue to pass without modification to their assertions.

### Requirement 13: Frontend renders Stage 2 state

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see score, lines, level, hold, and next piece, so that I can follow my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend receives game state THEN it SHALL display the current `score`, `total_lines`, and `level` from backend state.
2. WHEN the frontend receives game state THEN it SHALL display the `next_piece` preview from backend state.
3. WHEN `hold_piece` is non-null THEN the frontend SHALL display the held piece; WHEN it is `null` the frontend SHALL show an empty / no-hold indication.
4. WHEN `can_hold` is `false` THEN the frontend SHALL disable the Hold button; WHEN it is `true` and the game is playing THEN the Hold button SHALL be enabled.
5. WHEN the frontend renders THEN it SHALL NOT compute scoring, leveling, gravity, hold, or preview rules locally; these values come only from backend state.

### Requirement 14: Frontend Hold controls

**User Story:** As a player, I want to trigger Hold by button or key, so that holding is convenient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player clicks the Hold button while the game is playing AND Hold is allowed THEN the frontend SHALL send `POST /api/games/{id}/hold`.
2. WHEN the player presses the `C` key or the `c` key while the game is playing AND Hold is allowed THEN the frontend SHALL send `POST /api/games/{id}/hold`.
3. WHEN the existing controls are used (Left, Right, Soft Drop arrows and buttons, Restart) THEN they SHALL continue to function as in Stage 1.

### Requirement 15: Dynamic gravity scheduling on the frontend

**User Story:** As a player, I want the fall speed to match the backend level, so that pacing reflects progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the status is `playing` THEN the frontend SHALL schedule automatic ticks using the current `gravity_interval_ms` from backend state rather than a fixed 500 ms constant.
2. WHEN `gravity_interval_ms` changes in backend state THEN the frontend SHALL reschedule its automatic tick to the new interval.
3. WHEN the status is `game_over` THEN the frontend SHALL stop sending automatic ticks.

### Requirement 16: Frontend request ordering and lifecycle safety

**User Story:** As a player, I want the UI to stay consistent even with slow or overlapping requests, so that the board never jumps backward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN overlapping or out-of-order responses arrive THEN the frontend SHALL NOT apply a stale response that would reverse the visible game state.
2. WHEN the current game is replaced by create, restart, or disposal THEN a response belonging to the previous game generation SHALL NOT be applied to the new game, SHALL NOT use the new game's id, and SHALL NOT block the new game's request queue.
3. WHEN manual mutating requests are issued for the same game generation THEN the frontend SHALL serialize them in FIFO order.
4. WHEN a response is received THEN the frontend SHALL validate that it still belongs to the current game generation both after `fetch` resolves AND after `response.json()` resolves, including on the create / restart paths and in error and finally completions.
5. WHEN a stale request from a previous generation completes (including its error or finally handler) THEN it SHALL NOT clear the current generation's scheduling guard or pending timer.
6. WHEN a new game's Hold is triggered while a previous game's Hold response is still pending THEN the new game's Hold SHALL be able to proceed.
7. WHEN automatic ticks are scheduled THEN they SHALL be owned per game generation and coalesced to at most one queued or in-flight tick at a time, so that ticks do not burst after a slow network call.
8. WHEN manual input, restart, an interval change, game over, or component unmount occurs THEN the frontend SHALL cancel the exact pending tick timeout and, where applicable, reschedule using the latest authoritative interval.
9. WHEN the component passes through React StrictMode setup / cleanup / re-setup and through restart THEN the controls and scheduling SHALL remain correct.

### Requirement 17: English text and preserved boundaries

**User Story:** As a player, I want consistent English UI and no scope creep, so that the study stays controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend renders any label, status, or message THEN the visible text SHALL be in English.
2. WHEN Stage 2 is implemented THEN rotation, wall kicks, T-Spins, ghost piece, time attack, achievements, persistence, database, authentication, multiplayer, and high-score storage SHALL NOT be added.
3. WHEN Stage 2 is implemented THEN all game state SHALL remain in memory only.

### Requirement 18: Reproducible build, tests, and quality evidence

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want documented, reproducible verification, so that results are trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend tests are run with the documented command THEN they SHALL execute the Stage 1 regression tests plus new Stage 2 tests and pass, and SHALL be able to emit `docs/coverage.xml`.
2. WHEN the frontend production build is run with the documented command THEN it SHALL type-check and bundle without errors.
3. WHEN frontend tests are run with the documented command THEN they SHALL exercise production frontend paths and emit an LCOV report at `frontend/coverage/lcov.info` that includes all production files under `frontend/src`.
4. WHEN `npm audit` is run THEN the result SHALL be recorded honestly, including exact exit status, with the known baseline of 3 vulnerabilities (1 moderate, 2 high) and any applied compatible remediation.
5. WHEN the controlled quality gate is evaluated THEN new code coverage SHALL be at least 80%, new duplication at most 3%, and new violations zero, with no threshold weakening, no unjustified finding suppression, no exclusion of uncovered production files, no alteration of legacy regression assertions, and no claim of a passing gate without actual verification.

## Material Ambiguities and Assumptions

These are recorded for transparency and resolved with the stated assumption; they do not block specification.

1. **Hold-swap spawn-collision outcome.** The common seed states an obstructed spawn ends the game and that a held piece re-enters at the spawn origin. It does not explicitly say whether a Hold swap whose incoming piece cannot be placed ends the game. Assumption: it ends the game (`game_over`, active cleared), consistent with Stage 1 spawn-collision handling (Requirement 8.3). This is flagged for confirmation during design review.
2. **`next_piece` after game over.** The spec requires `next_piece` to be non-null while the game is readable. Assumption: `next_piece` continues to reflect the last drawn preview after `game_over` (no further draws occur); it is not nulled. Flagged for confirmation.
3. **Scoring rule naming.** The 100/300/500/800 values follow the classic single/double/triple/tetris table; the spec fixes the exact integers, so no external table is assumed as an input.
4. **Pre-lock vs post-lock level at boundary.** Requirement 4.5 fixes the interpretation (pre-lock level scores the clear, gravity updates after the level change). This is the single interpretation used throughout and is called out because it is the most error-prone case.
5. **Frontend test framework.** Stage 1 has no frontend test framework. A compatible framework will be selected and specified in design before implementation; it is not added in the specification-only phase.
