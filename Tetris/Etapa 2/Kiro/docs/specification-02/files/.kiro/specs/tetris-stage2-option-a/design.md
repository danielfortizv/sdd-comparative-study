# Design Document

## Overview

Stage 2, Option A extends the existing Stage 1 two-tier application (Python FastAPI backend, React + TypeScript frontend) as a brownfield change. The backend remains the single authoritative owner of all game state and rules; the frontend only renders backend state and forwards controls. No database, no authentication, in-memory state only.

Stage 2 adds, entirely inside the existing layered backend and the existing frontend structure:

- a **scoring** system (per-lock award by cleared-row count, multiplied by the pre-lock level),
- a **cumulative line counter** and derived **level**,
- a **progressive gravity interval** derived from level,
- a backend-owned **one-piece next-piece preview queue**,
- a **one-piece Hold** with once-per-active-piece availability,
- a new endpoint `POST /api/games/{id}/hold`,
- a frontend that renders the new fields, offers a Hold button and `C`/`c` key, and schedules gravity from `gravity_interval_ms` with strict request-ordering and lifecycle safety.

The design preserves every Stage 1 contract: `POST /api/games` returns HTTP 200; the board serializes to integer codes (`0` empty, `1..7` types); the active piece stays under the `active_piece` key; spawn origin is `(0,3)`; the seeded shuffled 7-bag and canonical unrotated shapes are unchanged; the lock → clear → spawn ordering is the baseline; and the 39 existing backend regression tests continue to pass unchanged.

The engine functions remain pure (no FastAPI imports) so rules stay unit-testable, including the isolated-domain fixtures needed to verify 3- and 4-row clears that ordinary unrotated play cannot reach.

### Request flow (Stage 2 additions in **bold**)

1. `POST /api/games` → `store.create()` → `engine.new_game(seed)`; returns serialized state **including the 7 new fields**.
2. `GET /api/games/{id}` → fetch; 404 if missing; returns serialized state **with no side effects (no generator draw, no counter change)**.
3. `POST /api/games/{id}/tick` → `engine.tick(game)`; a resulting lock runs `engine.lock`, which **scores, updates total_lines/level/gravity, then spawns (consuming the preview and drawing one new preview)**.
4. `POST /api/games/{id}/move` → validate direction; `engine.move`; `down` may lock (same scoring path); **soft drop never adds score**.
5. **`POST /api/games/{id}/hold` → `engine.hold(game)`; returns serialized state in the same shape.**

## Components and Interfaces

### Domain model changes (`domain/models.py`)

`Game` gains fields (names chosen to match the API payload one-to-one):

```python
@dataclass
class Game:
    id: str
    status: Status
    board: Board
    active: Optional[ActivePiece]
    rng: random.Random
    seed: int
    bag: List[PieceType]
    # --- Stage 2 additions ---
    score: int = 0
    total_lines: int = 0
    level: int = 1
    gravity_interval_ms: int = 500
    next_type: PieceType = ...      # the queued preview piece (always set while readable)
    hold_type: Optional[PieceType] = None
    can_hold: bool = True
```

Notes:
- `next_type` is the authoritative preview. It is populated during `new_game` by drawing the first preview from the 7-bag and is refilled whenever a spawn consumes it.
- `ActivePiece`, `Board`, `PieceType`, `Status`, `empty_board`, `ROWS`, `COLS` are unchanged.
- No shape or generator change; `pieces.py` is untouched.

### Scoring formulas (`rules/scoring.py`, new, pure)

```python
LINE_SCORES = {0: 0, 1: 100, 2: 300, 3: 500, 4: 800}

def line_award(cleared: int, pre_lock_level: int) -> int:
    return LINE_SCORES[cleared] * pre_lock_level

def level_for(total_lines: int) -> int:
    return 1 + total_lines // 10

def gravity_ms_for(level: int) -> int:
    return max(100, 500 - 50 * (level - 1))
```

These are the only places the numeric controls live, so they can be unit-tested directly and reused by the engine. `level_for(0..9) == 1`, `level_for(10..19) == 2`; `gravity_ms_for(1) == 500`, `gravity_ms_for(9) == 100`, `gravity_ms_for(10+) == 100`.

### Engine changes (`rules/engine.py`, pure)

The queue model: the engine keeps exactly one previewed type in `game.next_type`. A helper encapsulates "consume preview and draw one new preview":

```python
def _draw_preview(game) -> PieceType:
    return pieces.next_type(game.rng, game.bag)   # exactly one generator draw

def _consume_preview(game) -> PieceType:
    incoming = game.next_type
    game.next_type = _draw_preview(game)           # refill: exactly one draw
    return incoming
```

- `new_game(game_id, seed)`:
  1. build empty board, `score=0`, `total_lines=0`, `level=1`, `gravity_interval_ms=500`, `hold_type=None`, `can_hold=True`;
  2. `game.next_type = _draw_preview(game)` (first preview draw);
  3. `spawn(game)` which consumes that preview as the first active piece and draws the next preview.

- `spawn(game)`: instead of drawing a type directly, it now **consumes the preview** (`piece_type = _consume_preview(game)`), places it at `(SPAWN_ROW, SPAWN_COLUMN)`; on overlap → `game_over`, `active=None` (no extra draw beyond the one preview refill already performed). This keeps "normal spawn = exactly one preview draw" (Requirement 7.1).

- `lock(game)`:
  1. settle active cells into the board;
  2. `cleared = clear_lines(game)` (returns count — already exists);
  3. `pre_lock_level = game.level`; `game.score += scoring.line_award(cleared, pre_lock_level)`;
  4. `game.total_lines += cleared`; `game.level = scoring.level_for(game.total_lines)`; `game.gravity_interval_ms = scoring.gravity_ms_for(game.level)`;
  5. `game.can_hold = True` (re-enable Hold for the next active piece);
  6. `spawn(game)` (consumes preview, draws one new preview, may end the game).

  Ordering is preserved: settle → clear → score/level/gravity → re-enable hold → spawn. Scoring uses the **pre-lock** level captured before step 4.

- `tick(game)` / `move(game, direction)`: unchanged control flow; `down`/blocked-tick still route through `lock`. Soft drop adds no score because score only changes inside `lock` via `line_award` (Requirement 9).

- `hold(game)` (new):
  ```
  if game.status != "playing" or game.active is None: return          # Req 8.7, 10.1
  if not game.can_hold: return                                        # Req 8.4 reject, no draws
  current = game.active.type
  if game.hold_type is None:
      game.hold_type = current
      incoming = _consume_preview(game)          # one draw (Req 7.2)
  else:
      incoming = game.hold_type
      game.hold_type = current                   # swap, no draw (Req 7.3)
  cells = _absolute_cells(incoming, SPAWN_ORIGIN)
  if not _is_valid(game.board, cells):
      game.status = "game_over"; game.active = None   # Req 8.3
      game.can_hold = False
      return
  game.active = ActivePiece(incoming, SPAWN_ORIGIN, cells)
  game.can_hold = False                          # once per active piece (Req 8.1/8.2/8.5)
  ```
  `can_hold` returns to `True` only in `lock` when the next piece locks (Requirement 8.5).

State reads never call engine mutators, so reads cause zero generator draws and no counter changes (Requirements 6.5, 7.5, 10.3).

### API schema changes (`api/schemas.py`)

`GameStateOut` gains the new fields; the board stays integer-coded and the active piece stays under `active_piece`:

```python
class GameStateOut(BaseModel):
    id: str
    status: str
    board: List[List[int]]
    active_piece: Optional[ActivePieceOut]
    # Stage 2:
    score: int
    total_lines: int
    level: int
    gravity_interval_ms: int
    next_piece: PieceType
    hold_piece: Optional[PieceType]
    can_hold: bool
```

`serialize(game)` maps `game.next_type → next_piece`, `game.hold_type → hold_piece`, `game.can_hold → can_hold`, and copies the scalar counters. The existing board/active serialization is untouched, so the 39 regression tests (which assert the existing keys/values) continue to pass; they check `set(data.keys())` only in payload-shape tests that will be updated as *new* tests, while the legacy assertions remain intact. (See Testing Strategy for how the one legacy key-set test is handled without weakening it.)

### Controller changes (`api/games.py`)

Add one route, mirroring the existing pattern and 404 handling:

```python
@router.post("/{game_id}/hold", response_model=GameStateOut)
def hold_game(game_id: str) -> GameStateOut:
    game = _get_or_404(game_id)
    engine.hold(game)
    return serialize(game)
```

`POST /api/games` still returns HTTP 200 (FastAPI default for the existing decorator). Existing routes keep their signatures.

### Frontend changes

**`types.ts`** — `GameState` gains:
```ts
score: number;
total_lines: number;
level: number;
gravity_interval_ms: number;
next_piece: PieceType;
hold_piece: PieceType | null;
can_hold: boolean;
```

**`api.ts`** — add:
```ts
export async function holdGame(id: string): Promise<GameState> {
  const r = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/games/${id}/hold`, { method: "POST" });
  return asJson(r);
}
```

**`useGame.ts`** — the core of the lifecycle-safety requirements. Design:

- **Generation token.** A `generationRef` integer increments on every create/restart and on unmount-disposal. Every async operation captures the generation value at dispatch and compares it to `generationRef.current` after `await fetch(...)` and again after `await response.json()`; if they differ, the result is discarded and must not touch state, the scheduling guard, or the timer (Requirements 16.2, 16.4, 16.5). Create/restart themselves bump the generation first, so an in-flight old Hold cannot adopt the new id or block the new queue (Requirement 16.2, 16.6).
- **FIFO queue per generation.** A promise-chain (`queueRef`) serializes manual mutating requests (move, hold) in submission order for the current generation. Enqueued work re-checks the generation before applying its result, so stale completions drop out (Requirements 16.1, 16.3). A fresh generation starts a fresh queue so old queued work cannot block the new game.
- **Coalesced tick scheduler.** Automatic ticks are owned per generation via a single `timeoutRef`. At most one tick is queued or in flight: a new tick is scheduled only after the previous tick's response resolves (or is discarded), using `setTimeout(gravity_interval_ms)` rather than a fixed `setInterval`, which both honors the dynamic interval (Requirement 15) and prevents bursts behind slow network calls (Requirement 16.7).
- **Exact cancellation + reschedule.** Manual input, restart, interval change, game over, and unmount call a single `cancelTick()` that clears exactly the pending `timeoutRef` and nulls it; scheduling then resumes (when still playing) with the latest `gravity_interval_ms` (Requirement 16.8). Because the scheduler keys off the applied state's interval, a level-up reschedules automatically.
- **StrictMode safety.** The effects use stable refs and idempotent setup/cleanup so React 18 StrictMode's mount→unmount→remount does not leave an orphan timer or a stale generation; cleanup increments the generation (or sets a disposed flag) so a late response from the first mount is discarded (Requirement 16.9). Restart goes through the same generation bump path.
- **Guard clearing rule.** Only a completion whose captured generation equals the current generation may clear the scheduling guard or pending timer; stale error/finally handlers return early (Requirement 16.5).

Exposed API: `{ state, error, move, hold, restart }`.

**`App.tsx`** — add a `keydown` branch for `"c"`/`"C"` that calls `hold()` when playing; add a Hold button wired to `hold()` and `disabled` when `!can_hold || status !== "playing"`; keep existing Left/Right/Soft Drop/Restart controls and English labels; title updated to Stage 2.

**`Sidebar`/`Preview`** — render `score`, `total_lines`, `level` (and, for context, `gravity_interval_ms` optionally), the `next_piece` mini-grid, and the `hold_piece` mini-grid (empty state when `null`). Rendering only; no rule logic (Requirement 13.5).

## Data Models

- **Board:** unchanged `list[list[Optional[PieceType]]]`, serialized to integer codes.
- **Preview queue:** a single `PieceType` (`game.next_type`), not a list. "One-piece preview" means exactly one queued type; consuming it draws exactly one replacement.
- **Hold slot:** a single nullable `PieceType` (`game.hold_type`) plus a `can_hold` boolean gate.
- **Counters:** `score`, `total_lines`, `level`, `gravity_interval_ms` as integers on `Game`.

## Error Handling

- Unknown id on `GET`/`tick`/`move`/`hold` → HTTP 404 (reuses `_get_or_404`).
- Invalid/missing `direction` on `move` → HTTP 422 via Pydantic (unchanged).
- Hold while `can_hold` is `false`, or any action after `game_over` → engine no-op; serialized unchanged state returned (Requirements 8.4, 8.7, 10.1).
- Hold whose incoming piece cannot be placed → `game_over`, active cleared (Requirement 8.3).
- Frontend: non-OK responses throw and are surfaced via `error`; stale responses are silently discarded by the generation check and never shown as errors against the new game.

## Testing Strategy

Backend (`pytest`, extends existing files or adds Stage 2 files without altering the 39 legacy assertions):

- **Scoring (`rules/scoring.py`)**: `line_award` for 0/1/2/3/4 rows at several levels; `level_for` boundaries (9→1, 10→2); `gravity_ms_for` at levels 1, 9, 10+ (100 ms floor).
- **Isolated-domain multi-row clears (Requirement 5)**: explicitly labeled fixtures build a `Game` with prefilled complete rows and invoke the real `engine.lock`/`clear_lines` path to verify 1/2/3/4-row awards and the resulting `total_lines`/`level`/`gravity_interval_ms`. These fixtures do not mutate canonical shapes and do not claim rotated UI play. 0/1/2-row cases also covered via ordinary-style fixtures.
- **Pre-lock level boundary**: craft a game at `total_lines = 9 - k` so a clear crosses into level 10; assert the award uses pre-lock level 9 and `gravity_interval_ms` becomes 100 after.
- **Preview draw counts (Requirement 7)**: assert exactly one generator draw on normal spawn and on first Hold, zero on occupied-slot swap, zero on rejected Hold / reads / post-game-over actions. Verified by comparing bag/rng progression or by counting via a spy around `pieces.next_type`.
- **Hold mechanics (Requirement 8)**: empty-slot hold, occupied swap, rejection when `can_hold` false, re-enable after lock, spawn-collision on incoming piece → game over, 404 on unknown id, no-op after game over, response shape.
- **State read purity (Requirement 6.5/10.3)**: repeated `GET` leaves all fields and generator state unchanged.
- **API contract (Requirement 12)**: `POST /api/games` → 200 with the 7 new fields present; board still integer codes; `active_piece` key retained; new `hold` endpoint returns the same shape. The one legacy payload-shape test that asserts an exact key set (`test_state_payload_shape`) is preserved as-is for the active-piece sub-shape; the expanded top-level key set is asserted in a **new** test rather than by editing the legacy assertion, so no regression assertion is weakened.
- **Regression**: run the full suite to confirm all 39 legacy test functions still pass.

Frontend (a compatible test runner added during implementation — Vitest + Testing Library is the planned choice because it integrates natively with the existing Vite toolchain and can emit LCOV via `v8`/`istanbul` coverage; this selection is specified here and installed only in the implementation phase):

- Dynamic gravity scheduling: interval derived from `gravity_interval_ms`; reschedules on change; stops on game over.
- Request ordering / lifecycle: delayed `fetch` and delayed `response.json()` across restart; FIFO manual actions; stale error/finally paths discarded; old-vs-new Hold (new game's Hold proceeds while old Hold pending); repeated restart; queue isolation across generations; tick coalescing (no burst after slow tick); exact timeout cancellation on manual input/restart/interval change/game over/unmount; StrictMode setup/cleanup/re-setup.
- Rendering/controls: score/lines/level shown from state; next preview; hold display and disabled Hold button per `can_hold`; `C`/`c` key and Hold button click dispatch a hold request; existing controls still work.
- Tests exercise production modules (`frontend/src/*`) so LCOV at `frontend/coverage/lcov.info` includes all production files; assertions observe requests/state/timer timing rather than restating implementation internals.

### Verification distinctions and evidence

- **Isolated-domain evidence** (engine/scoring fixtures, including 3-/4-row clears) is labeled and kept separate from **user-visible / browser evidence** (frontend tests and the production build) in the recorded results.
- Build/coverage/audit artifacts to produce in the implementation phase: backend `docs/coverage.xml`; frontend `frontend/coverage/lcov.info`; TypeScript production build log; `npm audit` with exact exit status (baseline: 3 vulns — 1 moderate, 2 high — plan a compatible, non-breaking remediation such as a patch-level `vite` bump within the allowed range and record the final audit honestly).
- The controlled Sonar gate (new coverage ≥ 80%, new duplication ≤ 3%, zero new violations) is honored without weakening thresholds, suppressing findings without evidence, excluding uncovered production files, or altering legacy regression assertions.

### Native Feature Spec lifecycle note

This design was produced through the tool's native Feature Spec workflow (requirements → design → tasks) with artifacts under `.kiro/specs/tetris-stage2-option-a/`. Any actual limitation observed in automated workflow integration is recorded in the project research log rather than asserted here; the presence of the three Markdown artifacts alone is not treated as proof of workflow execution.
